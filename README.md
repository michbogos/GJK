# GJK

Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance algorithm is used to detect whether 2 convex polygons or polyhedra are intersecting. It is used in physics engines. This repository contains attempts at implementing and optimizing the GJK algorithm.

Right now only slow and inexact implementation in python. Still WIP.
